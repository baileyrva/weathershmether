# weathershmether
This repository ("weathershmether") is where I (Joe Bailey) developed my first weather application using JavaScript for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. The goal for this homework was to become more familiar with JavaScript and API calls by demonstrating the ability to create a weather application that focused on database basics. 

Installation

Being in the outdoors is an important part of my life, and it helps ground and remind me of what is truly important. Having the ability to check the weather at a moments notice, or a 5-Day forecast is very advantageous when exploring the outdoors. The app was developed using JavaScript, jQuery, and Open Weather API. 

Credits

I was the main creator of the main application and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver. I also used YouTube to find different videos on JavaScript, similar weather applications, and various troubleshooting tips.

Functionality

The app prompts the user with a text box to enter a city of their choosing. The app will then call the Open Weather API to display a set amount of parameters to the user. This includes current weather along with a 5-Day forecast.
